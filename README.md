# Page Object Model

### Brief
This is a programme created to practice creating a page object model and running tests on the data entered into a form.

RSPEC and selenium-webdriver are needed to run this programme.


### Difficulties
I had difficulties writing the selenium selection code for the marital status and hobby sections. The hobby in particular won't run if the cricket hobby is selected.

I also had difficulties with knowing what tests to run to check the correct data had been entered.

### What went well
I managed to get the basic field input tests and methods working fairly easily.
